    - "Are you sick of only being entertained by your computer?"
    - "Do you wish you could do things that aren't staring at a screen?"

tagline: "Read a book instead!"

disclaimer: "This is by no means a requirement, just a suggestion to help you stay on track and finish the book by the end date :)"

pacing:
    - "May 20 - May 27 :: pp 1-111"

explanation_title: "Wait what's happening?"
explanation:
    - "Some of the members of the #osu-lug community discovered that they all felt similarly about their constant use of technology. They realized that they'd rather find something else like a hobby, sport, or a book club."
    - "So basically a few members of the community hastily decided 'LETS START A BOOK CLUB!!!' and now this exists."
    - "We read a book every month and come together in meatspace to discuss the book. What we liked, what we didn't, etc."
    - "If you have a suggestion for a book to read, or you'd like to host the meetup contact Eli. If you got here you probably know how to do that already."
