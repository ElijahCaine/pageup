Wait what's happening?
----------------------

We read a book and congregate in meatspace to discuss what we read over drinks
and such.

Some of the members of the #osu-lug community realized they were unhappy with
their level of use of technology. As awesome as computers are they would rather
do something *away* from the screen now and then.

So basically a few members of the community hastily decided 'LETS START A BOOK
CLUB!!!' and now this exists.

We read a book every month and come together in meatspace to discuss said book.
What we liked, what we didn't, etc.

If you have a suggestion for a good title to read, or you'd like to host the
next meetup, contact Eli. If you got here you probably know how to do that
already.
